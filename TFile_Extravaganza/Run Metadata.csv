However, channel 7 was too thin of a pulse and wouldn't change the width without causing more problems. Checked high and low voltage, but they weren't the problem. Switched to another discriminator.

- scintillator voltage changed to 1350 V

Calorimeters:
- calorimeter 2 seems to be being hit the most, but many overflow events, so voltage is too high
- changed voltage on calo2 to 1150 V

we then moved the stage 10cm to the R
- changed voltage on calo1 to 1375 V

another 10cm to the R
- changed voltage on calo0 to 1165 V

then back to centre then 10cm L
- changed voltage on calo3 to 1175 V

another 10cm L
- changed voltage on calo4 to 1270 V

Graphing the angle of the particles via the Mimosa detector showed a strip with less high angles. The high angles are from scattering on the scintillator, which suggested the strip without that is b/ the scintillator was not entirely in the beam (*inside* the dark box). We checked and this was not the case. 

After the main particle (not offset) peak we saw a series of peaks decreasing in size and regularily spaced. It was suggested that the reason was this was that the event could contain 1 particle or 2 particles or 3, etcetera. Cristavao wrote a code to only plot it if only 1 track was shown in the Mimosa. That significantly decreased the secondary peaks, but they are still there. This is an important characteristic of the beam to remember for analysis.

   * When running with autotriggers (remember, Mimosas are rather slow), the shape was still visible, but without any edge
 * DESY Chain scintillator showed several, equidistant peaks

Conclusion: The trigger scintillator is off center, such that we trigger on occasional, largely deflected particles and a small part of the actual core beam.

Observations after action:
 * DWC and MMs show a fine peak
 * Mimosa hits are more or less symmetric
 * Scintillator signal shows only one peak.

##Config file notes
1) For the size of the mimosa detectors the config file gives the pitch (distance between pixels) and number of
pixels in the x and y directions
2) For the MMFE8 and TDC trees, there is also an ""N""+""branch name"" named tree. This is because the MMFE8 and TDC
can record multiple hits per event, so the N-branches give the number of hits per event in the corresponding branch",,,,,,,,,,

"We went into the beamline and attempted to add the 2cm thick scintillator. However, the space for the
scintillator to be inserted is exactly 2cm, and the 2cm scintillator is wrapped in tape and stuff so it doesn't
fit. :(

We also put some more tape on the calorimeters",,,,,,,,,,
