However, channel 7 was too thin of a pulse and wouldn't change the width without causing more problems. Checked high and low voltage, but they weren't the problem. Switched to another discriminator.

- scintillator voltage changed to 1350 V

Calorimeters:
- calorimeter 2 seems to be being hit the most, but many overflow events, so voltage is too high
- changed voltage on calo2 to 1150 V

we then moved the stage 10cm to the R
- changed voltage on calo1 to 1375 V

another 10cm to the R
- changed voltage on calo0 to 1165 V

then back to centre then 10cm L
- changed voltage on calo3 to 1175 V

another 10cm L
- changed voltage on calo4 to 1270 V

Graphing the angle of the particles via the Mimosa detector showed a strip with less high angles. The high angles are from scattering on the scintillator, which suggested the strip without that is b/ the scintillator was not entirely in the beam (*inside* the dark box). We checked and this was not the case. 

After the main particle (not offset) peak we saw a series of peaks decreasing in size and regularily spaced. It was suggested that the reason was this was that the event could contain 1 particle or 2 particles or 3, etcetera. Cristavao wrote a code to only plot it if only 1 track was shown in the Mimosa. That significantly decreased the secondary peaks, but they are still there. This is an important characteristic of the beam to remember for analysis.

   * When running with autotriggers (remember, Mimosas are rather slow), the shape was still visible, but without any edge
 * DESY Chain scintillator showed several, equidistant peaks

Conclusion: The trigger scintillator is off center, such that we trigger on occasional, largely deflected particles and a small part of the actual core beam.

Observations after action:
 * DWC and MMs show a fine peak
 * Mimosa hits are more or less symmetric
 * Scintillator signal shows only one peak.

##Config file notes
1) For the size of the mimosa detectors the config file gives the pitch (distance between pixels) and number of
pixels in the x and y directions
2) For the MMFE8 and TDC trees, there is also an ""N""+""branch name"" named tree. This is because the MMFE8 and TDC
can record multiple hits per event, so the N-branches give the number of hits per event in the corresponding branch",,,,,,,,,,

"We went into the beamline and attempted to add the 2cm thick scintillator. However, the space for the
